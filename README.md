# Scheduling Application

This application is made up of 3 seperate parts.

1. The Main REST API built with Node/Express
2. The Webapp built with React
3. The Marketing/Landing Page built with Next.js

- The Applications main Database will be <strong>Mongodb</strong>

   ```
3. Add the plugin and configure the Tailwind Config File
